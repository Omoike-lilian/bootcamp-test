# aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
WEEK 0 - Billing and Architecture

Creating Lucid chart Diagram
I was able to recreate the Lucid chart cruddur diagram as instructed
link to my work: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/f63c18e9-7182-4e59-a7f3-e07c4f317ee1/edit?viewport_loc=-350%2C-478%2C2443%2C947%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_ab3d98b2-0b89-4cc4-bf90-d6741630c957

Admin Account
I created an admin account in AWS.
However, I did not use my Admin account for thr homework.I instead created an I AM user account, 
added the user to a group and attached permissions to the group.
I went ahead to create a buget and set up billing alarm

I was able to install the AWS CLi in gitpod
I did install it in the aws-bootcamp=cruddur-2023 directory at first
then I uninstalled followung the instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/uninstall.html
then change directory to workspace and did the install again

Notes/Errors made
I was unable to commit the code to the required Week 0 markdown file, it kept throwing no such file found error message
the code was commited into the aws folder.....hope I don't get markdown for this.

I will try to reorganize my repo as much as i can.

This has been a rewarding, amazing experience. Had to do a lot of self study.

Challenges
Had to work all night to complete this due to work schedule.

Thank you for the opportunity!
